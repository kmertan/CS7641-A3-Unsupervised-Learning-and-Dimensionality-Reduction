This code is for Georgia Tech’s OMSCS CS 7641 assignment 3. The code is adapted from Jonathan Tay’s Github repository. The goal is to explore unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. First, run ‘python parse.py’ from the terminal to create the necessary .hdf files out of the .csv data files. Next run each of these files {benchmark.py, PCA.py, ICA.py, RP.py, RF.py} with ‘python <file_name>.py’ from the terminal. Each will produce an output you need to run clustering. Next run ‘./run.bat’ to execute the clustering.py file five times, one for the baseline dataset and once for each of the four dimensionality reduction algorithms. The data are processed in plots.R and output to ./output/plots/.
